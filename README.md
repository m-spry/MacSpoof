MacSpoofer README.md

I made this in about 20 minutes using AppleScript while eating lunch, its purpose is to make spoofing Mac Addresses on OS X easier without requiring other tools like Python. It works by running the built in ifconfig command for you, all you need to do is input your password and the Mac Address you'd like to spoof to.
